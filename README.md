# Networked Control System Stability Simulation

This project simulates the stability and control strategies within a networked control system, expanding upon concepts introduced in the paper **"Semantics of Instability in Networked Control."** It explores different control policies (based on G-function, F-function, and Lyapunov drift) to manage the system's **Age of System Instability (AOIS).**

---

## üìÑ Project Overview

The code models a system that can be in either a **stable** (AOIS = 0) or **unstable** (AOIS > 0) state. A controller attempts to stabilize the system by sending messages, which can be **compressed** or **uncompressed**, each incurring a different energy cost.

The core objective is to **minimize a cost function** that considers both the energy expended on control actions and the "cost" of being in an unstable state (represented by the AOIS value).

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multiple Control Policies**: Simulate system behavior under three distinct control strategies:  
  - **G-function based**: Decision-making minimizing a cost-to-go function (`determin_next_G`).  
  - **F-function based**: Decision-making minimizing a cost related to system state transitions (`determin_next_F`).  
  - **Lyapunov Drift based**: Control decisions driven by minimizing Lyapunov drift to achieve stability (`pick_lyapunov`).  

- **Dynamic AOIS Simulation**: Track the Age of System Instability over time, observing how control actions influence its evolution.

- **Parameter Customization**: Easily adjust key system and control parameters to explore various scenarios.

- **Optimal Parameter Search**: Mode to find optimal parameters for the Lyapunov function.

- **Visualizations**: Plots showing:  
  - Evolution of AOIS over time with control actions highlighted  
  - Distribution of AOIS values during simulation  
  - Lyapunov drift over time and convergence
